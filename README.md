## Seminar

The goal for this course is to introduce a procedure of Machine Learning
    &rarr classification scheme on constrained devices 
    &arr preferably trained on the constrained device (If its not possible then train it on the notebook)

## Exam

- Presentation of a theory part
- Show what the model can recognize
- Each team should introduce to 2 algorithms of machine learning
    &rarr like kmeans, mse
