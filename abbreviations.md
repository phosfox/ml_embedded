# ReLu:
ReLu stands for Rectified Linear Unit. It is an linear activation function that will output the input directly if it is positive, otherwise it will output zero. It can we written as: `ReLu = max(0,input)`

# Facebook PyTorch:
PyTorch is an open source machine learning library which is mainly developed by Facebook.
# Model Zoo:
# COCO:
COCO stands for Common Objects in Context. COCO is a dataset for object recognition created by Microsoft. It contains 91 object types that could be easily recognized by a 4 year old. The common objects are placed in complex everyday scenes in their natural context. With a total of 2.5Million labeled instances in 328k images. The images are set in the scene of everyday scenarios and in their natural context. 
# itFrozen Model:
# Nvidia CUDA:
CUDA stands for Compute Unified Device Architecure. It is a parallel computing platform and API model developed by Nvidia. It allows the usage of CUDA-enabled GPUs for general purpose processing (GPGPU). Using the GPU for highly parallel task can speed up the application by huge amount.
