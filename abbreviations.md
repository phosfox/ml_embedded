# ReLu:

ReLu stands for Rectified Linear Unit. It is an linear activation function that will output the input directly if it is positive, otherwise it will output zero. It can we written as: `ReLu = max(0,input)`

# COCO:

COCO stands for Common Objects in Context. COCO is a dataset for object recognition created by Microsoft. It contains 91 object types that could be easily recognized by a 4 year old. The common objects are placed in complex everyday scenes in their natural context. With a total of 2.5Million labeled instances in 328k images. The images are set in the scene of everyday scenarios and in their natural context.

## Linear Regression:

[Linear Regression](http://wiki.fast.ai/index.php/Linear_Regression) is a supervised machine learning algorithm where the predicted output is continuous and has a constant slope. Is used to predict values within a continuous range. (e.g. sales, price, height) rather than trying to classify them into categories (e.g. cat, dog, chipmunk).

### Simple Linear Regression

Simple linear regression uses traditional slope-intercept form, where `m` and `b` are the variables our algorithm will try to "learn" to produce the most accurate predictions. `x` represents our input data and `y` represents our prediction.

Formula:
`y = mx + b`

# Transfer-Learning:

[Transfer learning](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transfer_learning) focuses on storing knowledge gained while solving one problem and applying it to a different but related problem. For example, knowledge gained while learning to recognize cars could apply when trying to recognize trucks.
