# CNN:
[CNN](https://towardsdatascience.com/applied-deep-learning-part-4-convolutional-neural-networks-584bc134c1e2) stands for Convolutional Neural Networks. It is a deep learning architecture for image related problems and has a very good accuracy. CNN is able to automatically detect the important features (distinctive features) without any human supervision. 
# R-CNN:
[R-CNN](https://lilianweng.github.io/lil-log/2017/12/31/object-recognition-for-dummies-part-3.html) stands for Region-based Convolutional Neural Networks. [R-CNN try to solve the problem to locate objects in an image](https://towardsdatascience.com/r-cnn-3a9beddfd55a) (objekt detection). It does so by proposing regions of interest within the image. These regions are warped into a square and fed into a CNN. 
# Mask R-CNN:
# ReLu:
ReLu stands for Rectified Linear Unit. It is an linear activation function that will output the input directly if it is positive, otherwise it will output zero. It can we written as: `ReLu = max(0,input)`

# Nearest-Neighbours:
# Google Tensorflow:
Tensorflow is an open source library for dataflow and differentiable programming. It is monstly used for machine learning applications.
# Facebook PyTorch:
PyTorch is an open source machine learning library which is mainly developed by Facebook.
# Model Zoo:
# COCO:
COCO stands for Common Objects in Context. COCO is a dataset for object recognition created by Microsoft. It contains 91 object types that could be easily recognized by a 4 year old. The common objects are placed in complex everyday scenes in their natural context. With a total of 2.5Million labeled instances in 328k images. The images are set in the scene of everyday scenarios and in their natural context. 
# itFrozen Model:
# Nvidia CUDA:
CUDA stands for Compute Unified Device Architecure. It is a parallel computing platform and API model developed by Nvidia. It allows the usage of CUDA-enabled GPUs for general purpose processing (GPGPU). Using the GPU for highly parallel task can speed up the application by huge amount.
